    "    The information includes venue names, locations, menus and even photos. Therefore, to obtain all this information, the foursquare location API will be used as the sole data source.\n",
    "    After listing the neighborhoods, I will connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood.\n",
    "    For each neighborhood, the radius will be 100 meter. The data retrieved from Foursquare will contain information as below:\n",
